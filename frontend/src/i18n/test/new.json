  "Adjust the speed of the cooling fan by setting a percentage value between 0 and 100. The default value is usually 100, which means the fan will run at full speed. Lowering the fan speed can reduce noise and save energy, but may also affect print quality if the printer gets too hot.": "",
  "Adjust the speed of your 3D printer by changing the speed of all movement commands by a specified factor. The default value is 100%, meaning that the printer will move at its standard speed. Lowering the print speed factor will slow down your print, while increasing it will speed it up. Value of 200% will double the speed.": "",
  "Flow rate is the speed at which the printer extrudes plastic.
