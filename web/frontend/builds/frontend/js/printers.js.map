The most common reasons are:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Camera resolution is set too high.</li>\n            <li>Camera framerate is set too high.

This means if you set the webcam resolution to 1024x768 (~800k pixels), you need to have 4.5Mbps upload bandwidth. Also remember that the upload bandwidth of your Raspberry Pi may not be the same as your computer, even if they are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
