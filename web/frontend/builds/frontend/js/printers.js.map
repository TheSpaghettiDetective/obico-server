If you still see this warning, you need to trouble-shoot your computer's Wi-Fi connection, probably by moving closer to the Wi-Fi router.</p>\n          <p>If the webcam stream is smooth when your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Pi, the bottleneck is likely with the upload speed of your internet connection. You need to run a speed test to make sure you have high-enough upload speed, as well as <b>low latency (ping)</b>.</p>\n          <p>Check out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/docs/webcam-feed-is-laggy/\">the step-by-step trouble-shooting guide.</a></p>\n        `,\n        showCloseButton: true,\n      })\n    },\n\n    showMutedStatusDescription(event) {\n      event.preventDefault()\n\n      this.$swal({\n        title: 'Webcam stream buffering',\n        html: `\n          <p>When you see the messaging about webcam stream is \"buffering\" occassionaly, you can just reload the page. If this message repeatedly appears, it usually indicates a constricted video stream on <strong>your Raspberry Pi, not your computer</strong>.</p>\n          <p>The most common reasons are:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Camera resolution is set too high.</li>\n            <li>Camera framerate is set too high. This is only when you set <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/docs/streaming-compatibility-mode/\">the compatibility mode</a> to \"always\".</li>\n            <li>The upload speed of your Raspberry Pi is too low.</li>\n          </ul>\n          <br>\n          <p>You should leave the compatibility mode to \"auto\", unless you have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/docs/streaming-compatibility-mode/#are-there-situations-when-i-want-to-always-stream-in-compatibility-mode\">a good reason to it to \"always\".</a></p>\n          <p>As a rule of thumb, for every 300k-pixel resolution (640x480), you need to have 1.5Mbps upload bandwidth to stream smoothly at 25fps. This means if you set the webcam resolution to 1024x768 (~800k pixels), you need to have 4.5Mbps upload bandwidth. Also remember that the upload bandwidth of your Raspberry Pi may not be the same as your computer, even if they are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is because Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi chip is weaker than the most computers'.</p>\n        `,\n        showCloseButton: true,\n      })\n    }\n    /** End of video warning handling */\n
