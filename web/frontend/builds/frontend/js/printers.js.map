This means if you set the webcam resolution to 1024x768 (~800k pixels), you need to have 4.5Mbps upload bandwidth. Also remember that the upload bandwidth of your Raspberry Pi may not be the same as your computer, even if they are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

Paste it in main.scss file inside :root styles\n *\n * Colors usage in CSS:\n * background: rgb(var(--color-...))\n *\n * Why translate HEX to RGB?\n * It's a trick to be able to add transparency to any color without creating new variable. For\n * example, primary color \"#9965f4\" will be trasformed to \"153 101 244\" (RGB numbers). Since rgb()\n * func allows us to add transparency with \"/\" after numbers, we can write semi-trasparent primary\n * color as \"rgb(153 101 244 / .5)\" or using variable \"rgb(var(--color-primary) / .5)\". If you'll\n * find more elegant way to implement it or you won't need transparency change, feel free to get rid\n * of HEXtoRGB() function and use colors directly.\n *\n * HINT: install 'Color Highlight' VSCode extension to see actual colors here\n */\nconst colors = [\n  {name: 'primary-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#B289F8', [Themes.Dark]: '#9A6AEF'}},\n  {name: 'primary',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#9965f4', [Themes.Dark]: '#A57BEE'}},\n  {name: 'on-primary',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'secondary',                values: {[Themes.Light]: '#28303A', [Themes.Dark]: '#EBEBEB'}},\n  {name: 'on-secondary',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EBEBEB', [Themes.Dark]: '#28303A'}},\n\n  {name: 'success',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#5cb85c', [Themes.Dark]: '#5cb85c'}},\n  {name: 'success-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#4CAE4C', [Themes.Dark]: '#4CAE4C'}},\n  {name: 'on-success',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'danger',                   values: {[Themes.Light]: '#d9534f', [Themes.Dark]: '#d9534f'}},\n  {name: 'danger-variant',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#C2413D', [Themes.Dark]: '#C2413D'}},\n  {name: 'on-danger',                values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'warning',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f0ad4e', [Themes.Dark]: '#f0ad4e'}},\n  {name: 'warning-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#DB9A3F', [Themes.Dark]: '#DB9A3F'}},\n  {name: 'on-warning',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n  {name: 'on-warning-2',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#000000', [Themes.Dark]: '#000000'}},\n\n  {name: 'background',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EBEBEB', [Themes.Dark]: '#233141'}},\n  {name: 'surface-primary',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#485B71'}},\n  {name: 'surface-secondary',        values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f5f5f5', [Themes.Dark]: '#2D3E4F'}},\n  {name: 'overlay',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f5f5f5', [Themes.Dark]: '#000000'}},\n  {name: 'hover',                    values: {[Themes.Light]: '#666666', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'divider',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ABB6C2', [Themes.Dark]: '#6A7B8A'}},\n\n  {name: 'text-primary',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#28303A', [Themes.Dark]: '#EBEBEB'}},\n  {name: 'text-secondary',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#8A94A2', [Themes.Dark]: '#AAACB0'}},\n\n  {name: 'input-background',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#E2E8ED', [Themes.Dark]: '#42566B'}},\n\n  {name: 'table-accent-1',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#E3E3E3', [Themes.Dark]: '#27323F'}},\n  {name: 'table-accent-2',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EDEDED', [Themes.Dark]: '#1B242E'}},\n\n  // Icon colors\n  {name: 'icon-tunneling-1',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#4e5d6c', [Themes.Dark]: '#EAEAEA'}},\n  {name: 'icon-tunneling-2',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#1d2935', [Themes.Dark]: '#CDCDCD'}},\n  {name: 'icon-navbar-brand',        values: {[Themes.Light]: '#7B8993', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n]\n\nconst urls = [\n  {\n    name: 'logo-bg',\n    values: {\n      [Themes.Light]: 'url(\"/static/img/logo-bg/logo-bg_light.svg\")',\n      [Themes.Dark]: 'url(\"/static/img/logo-bg/logo-bg_dark.svg\")'\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'tail-spin',\n    values: {\n      [Themes.Light]: 'url(\"/static/img/tail-spin/tail-spin_light.svg\")',\n      [Themes.Dark]: 'url(\"/static/img/tail-spin/tail-spin_dark.svg\")'\n    }\n  },\n]\n\n// Converts HEX color to RGB\nfunction HEXtoRGB(color) {\n  const result = /^#?([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})$/i.exec(color)\n  if (!result) { console.log('Wrong HEX value!') }\n  return [parseInt(result[1], 16), parseInt(result[2], 16), parseInt(result[3], 16)]\n}\n\n// Defines theme by value saved in LocalStorage or system settings\nexport function initTheme() {\n  console.log('Init theme')\n\n  let themeValue = localStorage.getItem('colorTheme')\n  let themeSystem = themeValue === Themes.System\n  // let themeSystem = themeValue === null || themeValue === Themes.System\n\n  if (themeSystem) {\n    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme)').media !== 'not all') {\n      themeValue = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)').matches ?
