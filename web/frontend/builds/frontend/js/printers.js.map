The most common reasons are:</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Camera resolution is set too high.</li>\n            <li>Camera framerate is set too high.

The internet connection of your computer or phone is not fast enough.</p>\n          <p class=\"lead\">3. Your webcam is not properly connected to your Raspberry Pi.</p>\n          <br>\n          <p>You should leave the compatibility mode to \"auto\", unless you have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/docs/streaming-compatibility-mode#when-should-i-always-stream-in-the-compatibility-mode\">a good reason to it to \"always\".</a></p>\n          <p>As a rule of thumb, for every 300k-pixel resolution (640x480), you need to have 1.5Mbps upload bandwidth to stream smoothly at 25fps. This means if you set the webcam resolution to 1024x768 (~800k pixels), you need to have 4.5Mbps upload bandwidth. Also remember that the upload bandwidth of your Raspberry Pi may not be the same as your computer, even if they are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

For\n * example, primary color \"#9965f4\" will be trasformed to \"153 101 244\" (RGB numbers). Since rgb()\n * func allows us to add transparency with \"/\" after numbers, we can write semi-trasparent primary\n * color as \"rgb(153 101 244 / .5)\" or using variable \"rgb(var(--color-primary) / .5)\". If you'll\n * find more elegant way to implement it or you won't need transparency change, feel free to get rid\n * of HEXtoRGB() function and use colors directly.\n *\n * HINT: install 'Color Highlight' VSCode extension to see actual colors here\n */\nconst colors = [\n  {name: 'primary-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#B289F8', [Themes.Dark]: '#9A6AEF'}},\n  {name: 'primary',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#9965f4', [Themes.Dark]: '#A57BEE'}},\n  {name: 'on-primary',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'secondary',                values: {[Themes.Light]: '#28303A', [Themes.Dark]: '#EBEBEB'}},\n  {name: 'on-secondary',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EBEBEB', [Themes.Dark]: '#28303A'}},\n\n  {name: 'success',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#5cb85c', [Themes.Dark]: '#5cb85c'}},\n  {name: 'success-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#4CAE4C', [Themes.Dark]: '#4CAE4C'}},\n  {name: 'on-success',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'danger',                   values: {[Themes.Light]: '#d9534f', [Themes.Dark]: '#d9534f'}},\n  {name: 'danger-variant',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#C2413D', [Themes.Dark]: '#C2413D'}},\n  {name: 'on-danger',                values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'warning',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f0ad4e', [Themes.Dark]: '#f0ad4e'}},\n  {name: 'warning-variant',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#DB9A3F', [Themes.Dark]: '#DB9A3F'}},\n  {name: 'on-warning',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n  {name: 'on-warning-2',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#000000', [Themes.Dark]: '#000000'}},\n\n  {name: 'background',               values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EBEBEB', [Themes.Dark]: '#233141'}},\n  {name: 'surface-primary',          values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ffffff', [Themes.Dark]: '#485B71'}},\n  {name: 'surface-secondary',        values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f5f5f5', [Themes.Dark]: '#2D3E4F'}},\n  {name: 'overlay',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#f5f5f5', [Themes.Dark]: '#000000'}},\n  {name: 'hover',                    values: {[Themes.Light]: '#666666', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n\n  {name: 'divider',                  values: {[Themes.Light]: '#ABB6C2', [Themes.Dark]: '#6A7B8A'}},\n\n  {name: 'text-primary',             values: {[Themes.Light]: '#28303A', [Themes.Dark]: '#EBEBEB'}},\n  {name: 'text-secondary',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#8A94A2', [Themes.Dark]: '#AAACB0'}},\n  {name: 'text-help',                values: {[Themes.Light]: '#4c9be8', [Themes.Dark]: '#4c9be8'}},\n\n\n  {name: 'input-background',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#E2E8ED', [Themes.Dark]: '#42566B'}},\n\n  {name: 'table-accent-1',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#E3E3E3', [Themes.Dark]: '#27323F'}},\n  {name: 'table-accent-2',           values: {[Themes.Light]: '#EDEDED', [Themes.Dark]: '#1B242E'}},\n\n  // Icon colors\n  {name: 'icon-tunneling-1',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#4e5d6c', [Themes.Dark]: '#EAEAEA'}},\n  {name: 'icon-tunneling-2',         values: {[Themes.Light]: '#1d2935', [Themes.Dark]: '#CDCDCD'}},\n  {name: 'icon-navbar-brand',        values: {[Themes.Light]: '#7B8993', [Themes.Dark]: '#ffffff'}},\n]\n\nconst urls = [\n  {\n    name: 'logo-bg',\n    values: {\n      [Themes.Light]: 'url(\"/static/img/logo-bg/logo-bg_light.svg\")',\n      [Themes.Dark]: 'url(\"/static/img/logo-bg/logo-bg_dark.svg\")'\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'tail-spin',\n    values: {\n      [Themes.Light]: 'url(\"/static/img/tail-spin/tail-spin_light.svg\")',\n      [Themes.Dark]: 'url(\"/static/img/tail-spin/tail-spin_dark.svg\")'\n    }\n  },\n]\n\nconst shadows = [\n  {\n    name: 'widget',\n    values: {\n      [Themes.Light]: '0px 3px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',\n      [Themes.Dark]: '0px 3px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'\n    }\n  },\n]\n\n// Converts HEX color to RGB\nfunction HEXtoRGB(color) {\n  const result = /^#?([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})([a-f\\d]{2})$/i.exec(color)\n  if (!result) { console.log('Wrong HEX value!') }\n  return [parseInt(result[1], 16), parseInt(result[2], 16), parseInt(result[3], 16)]\n}\n\n// Defines theme by value saved in LocalStorage or system settings\nexport function initTheme() {\n  let themeValue = localStorage.getItem('colorTheme')\n  let themeSystem = themeValue === Themes.System\n  // let themeSystem = themeValue === null || themeValue === Themes.System\n\n  if (themeSystem) {\n    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme)').media !== 'not all') {\n      themeValue = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)').matches ?
