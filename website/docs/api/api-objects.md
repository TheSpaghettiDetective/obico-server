## `Printer`

An object that represents a printer.

- `id`: ID used in API path. *ReadOnly*
- `name`: Printer name.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the printer is created. In ISO-8601 format.
- `action_on_failure`: What to do when a possible failure is detected. An `Enum`.
    - `PAUSE`: The print will be paused automatically. Note: when the detection (prediction score) is not very high, the print won't be paused. An alert will be sent instead in this case.
    - `NONE`: No action. Since an alert will always be sent, `NONE` means the user will still receive an alert.
- `watching_enabled`: If the failure detection is enabled by the user. Note: even if the failure detection is enabled, the system may not actively watch a print, for one reason or another. See `not_watching_reason` for details.
- `not_watching_reason`: A textual representation of why a print is not being actively watch.
    - *AI failure detection is disabled*: `watching_enabled` is set to `false`
    - *You have run out of AI Detection Hours*: The `dh_balance` in the [`User`](#user) object is 0 or a negative number.
    - *Printer is not actively printing*: Either `current_print` is `null`, or the printer is paused.
    - *Alerts are muted for current print*: The user has selected "mute alert for the rest of the print".
- `tools_off_on_pause`: Whether or not the tool (hotend) heater should be shut off when a print is paused.
- `bed_off_on_pause`: Whether or not the print bed heater should be shut off when a print is paused.
- `retract_on_pause`: The distance (in mm) the filament should be retracted when a print is paused. No retraction when it's 0.
- `lift_z_on_pause`: The distance (in mm) of the z-lift when a print is paused. No z-lift when it's 0.
- `detective_sensitivity`: The sensitivity for the failure detection. It should be a value between 0.8 (lowest sensitivity) and 1.2 (highest sensitivity).
- `pic`: The most recent webcam image for the printer. An object. Currently it has only 1 property.
    - `img_url`: The url to the image.
- `status`: An [`PrinterStatus`](#printerstatus) object.
- `settings`: An [`PrinterSettings`](#printersettings) object.
- `current_print`: An [`Print] object that represents the current print job of the printer. `Null` when the printer is idle.
- `normalized_p`: A normalized *prediction score* for failure detection. It's a number between 0 and 1. 0 means no failure is detected. 1 means the maximum confidence on predicting a print failure.
- `auth_token`: The token the printer can use to authenticate itself.

## `PrinterStatus`

- `state`: A [`State`](#state) object.
- `job`: A [`Job`](#job) object.
- `progress`: A [`JobProgress`](#jobprogress) object.

- `flags.error`: true if an unrecoverable error occurred, false otherwise
- `flags.ready`: true if the printer is operational and no data is currently being streamed to SD, so ready to receive instructions
- `flags.closedOrError`: true if the printer is disconnected (possibly due to an error), false otherwise

- `printTimeLeft`: Estimate of time left to print, in seconds
- `printTimeLeftOrigin`: Origin of the current time left estimate. Can currently be either of:
    - `linear`: based on an linear approximation of the progress in file in bytes vs time

    - `mixed-analysis`: mixture of estimate and analysis
    - `mixed-average`: mixture of estimate and average

## `Temperatures`

An `Map` object. The `key` of the map is the name of the heater, such as "tool0", "bed". The `value` of the map is an [`Temperature`](#temperature) object.

## `Temperature`

- `actual`: Current temperature
- `target`: Target temperature, may be null if no target temperature is set.
- `offset`: Currently configured temperature offset to apply, will be left out for historic temperature information.

## `PrinterSettings`
