title: Self-hosted Obico Server Guides
---

You don't need to be a programmer, or a superman, to self-host an Obico Server. However, the following skills are highly desired:

- A basic understanding on how Docker container works.
- Basic knowledge about Linux command lines. All Obico Docker containers are built from Linux images.
    - If you are hosting your Obico Server on a Window system, you will also need to know how to use Window commands or Windows Power Shell.
- A solid understanding on networking - IP addresses, port, routing, firewall, DNS, etc. Obico is an open-source project to connect all 3D Printers. So networking is at the core of the project.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
