title: Hardware requirements
---

The Spaghetti Detective runs a powerful Machine Learning model that requires a device powerful enough to run it. And by powerful, we mean most anything from the last decade. 

## Single Board Computers
*only tested / known devices are included*
Device | Can run TSD
:---|:---:
Raspberry Pi(any model) | ❌
Latte Panda | ❌
Jetson Nano 2gb | ❌
Jetson Nano 4gb | ✅

## PC's (and laptops)

If it has at least 4gb of RAM, it should run fine. 
Component | Requirement
:---|:---
CPU | One that can run a modern OS. CPU's as old as 4th gen intels have been able to run TSD just fine.  
GPU | A GPU of somekind is **required**. Any integrated GPU's should be fine, and discrete cards are more than enough.
RAM | You should have at least 4gb of DDR3 ram, but the more the better. 
OS |Your OS should also be recent(~3-5 old max). For older devices, Linux is **highly** recommended.
RGB | Highly recommended. The more your PC looks like a christmas tree, the more FPS you will have (sarcasm)
