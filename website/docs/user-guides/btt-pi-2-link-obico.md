This guide will show you how to link Obico on your [BigTreeTech Pi 2](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-x-obico-bigtreetech-pi-2-ai). Thanks to the collaboration between BTT and Obico, Obico's software is pre-installed on the BTT Pi 2 giving all users access to AI failure detection and remote 3d printer access. 

Link your printer to get access to webcam streaming, print status and failure notifications, 3D printer monitoring/control and more all from your phone.

## Step 1: Sign up for an Obico account {#step-1-sign-up-for-an-obico-account}

:::tip

Follow instructions in the "**üì±  Mobile App**" tab if you are using the Obico mobile app, or the "**üåê  Web App**" tab if you are using the web app.

:::info

Your Obico account is the same for the mobile app and the web app. If you sign up for an account using the mobile app, you can sign in to the web app later with the same email and password. And vice versa.

:::

:::info

All functions are available equally in the mobile and the web app. However, with the mobile app, you can receive push notifications on your phone to easily track the print progress, and get alerted in case a failure is detected.

## Step 3: Launch the "Link Printer" wizard in the Obico app {#step-3-launch-the-link-printer-wizard-in-the-obico-app}

:::tip

If your phone or computer is one the **the same local network** as your Klipper is, the Obico app can find your Klipper machine automatically. This is the easiest way to link your printer to your Obico account.

:::

<Tabs
  groupId="app"
  defaultValue="mobile"
  values={[
    {label: 'üì±  Mobile App', value: 'mobile'},
    {label: 'üåê  Web App', value: 'web'},

2. Choose ‚ÄúBTT Pi 2‚Äù on the next screen.
3. Click "Next"
4. The app will start scanning for the Klipper printer connected to the same local network.
5. If a printer is found, simply click the "Link" button and the app will do the rest for you.

:::tip
  If, however, the app can't find your Klipper printer after 1 minute of scanning, you need to follow the **[Manual Setup Guide](#link-manually)** to link your printer using a one-time passcode.
:::

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}><img src="/img/user-guides/setupguide/auto-link-klipper-mobile.gif" /></div>

## Step 4: Restart the BTT Pi. {#restart-pi}

Once the BTT Pi has booted up, you should be able to see your printer and the webcam stream in the Obico app.

## What's next? {#whats-next}

### Check out your printer feed! {#check-out-your-printer-feed}

Press "Go Check Out Printer Feed!" to see everything you care about your printer: the webcam feed, heater temperature, time remaining on the print job, and more! Remember, you can see your printer feed anywhere you go, as long as you have an internet connection on your phone!

### Test the magical failure detection! {#test-the-magical-failure-detection}

The Detective sounds too magical to be true? [See The Detective in action for yourself](/docs/user-guides/how-to-test-failure-detection).

### Change printer settings. {#change-printer-settings}

The default settings for your printer in The Spaghetti Detective are the ones that most users find the most reasonable. But feel free to tweak them to your liking:

- [Change notification settings](/docs/user-guides/notification-settings) (mobile app only). By default you receive push notifications when The Detective finds something fishy, and for the status of whatever your printer is printing. But you can choose to receive a lot more.
- [Change printer settings](/docs/user-guides/detection-print-job-settings), such as if The Detective should pause your printer when a failure is detected.

## Link Your Printer Manually With One-Time Passcode  - Mobile and Web{#link-manually}

:::tip
Only follow this section if linking your printer automatically in [step 3](#step-3-launch-the-link-printer-wizard-in-the-obico-app) did not work.

2. Run the following commands

```cd moonraker-obico```

```./install.sh```

3. Follow the instructions given in the terminal

4. Go back to the printer scanning screen in the mobile app (from [Step 3](#step-3-launch-the-link-printer-wizard-in-the-obico-app)), tap **"switch to manual linking".** 
5. Tap **"KIAUH or ./install.sh"**
