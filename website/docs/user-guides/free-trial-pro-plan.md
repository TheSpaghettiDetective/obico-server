When you sign up for a The Spaghetti Detective account, we will give you **1 month of FREE trial**. During the free trial period, we want you to get to know The Detective, and fully explore all that she is capable of, so we give you 250 [AI Detection Hours](/docs/user-guides/how-does-detective-hour-work) in addition to unlimited access to all Pro features.

At the end of the free trial, you can [upgrade to the Pro plan for little more than a Starbucks per month](https://app.obico.io/ent_pub/pricing/) to keep all the Pro features.

Or you can choose to do nothing and let the free trial expire. In this case, your account will automatically converted to the Free plan. If you didn't exhaust the 250 AI Detection Hours, the unused hours will also expire at the end of the free trial.
