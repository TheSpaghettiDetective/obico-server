title: Getting Started with Obico
---

To get started with Obico, you need to have installed and set up either OctoPrint, or the Klipper/Moonraker/Mainsail/Fluidd platform.

If you have set up Klipper with OctoPrint, don't select "Obico for Klipper". Select "Obico for OctoPrint" instead.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

The plan to support other platforms, such as Duet3D, is on our roadmap.
