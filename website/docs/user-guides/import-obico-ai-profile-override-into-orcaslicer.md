title: How to import Obico AI profile override into OrcaSlicer
---

## 1. Make sure you selected the correct printer, filament, and print process profiles

At the beginning of each session, the AI assistant will show you the selected printer, filament, and print process profiles. Make sure they are what you will use to print. The recommendations the AI assistant makes are based on the selected profiles.

:::caution
You also need to make sure the selected printer, filament, and print process profiles are also in OrcaSlicer. Otherwise, you won't be able to import the profile override in the next step.

## 3. Import the Obico AI profile override into OrcaSlicer

Open OrcaSlicer, go to **File** > **Import** > **Import Configs**, and select the profile override file(s) you downloaded in the previous step.

If the AI assistant has recommended multiple profile overrides, you will need to import them one by one.

## 4. Select the override(s) in OrcaSlicer before you slice the print

OrcaSlicer will NOT automatically select the override(s) you imported in the previous step. You need to manually select the override(s) before you slice the print.
