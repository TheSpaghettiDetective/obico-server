:::

## **Setup the Hardware**

### **1. Unbox the Kit**

Unbox your kit and lay out the components:

**The kit includes**

- Orange Pi Zero 2
- Heatsink
- USB Hub
- 5V 3A USB C Power Supply
- USB Webcam
- Official Orange Pi Zero 2 case (not recommended - use the printable version)

**You will also need**

- A high-quality SD card (class 10 or better) with at least 8GB of storage
- An Ethernet cable
- A USB cable to connect the Orange Pi to your printer (comes with most printers)


### **2. Install the heat sink on the Orange Pi Zero 2**

- Remove one side of the paper backing on the thermal pad and place the pad on the heat sink. Remove the other paper from the other side and place the heat sink on the CPU

### **3. Put the Orange Pi in the Case**

While putting your Orange Pi Zero 2 is not required, it is recommended to help keep it clean and safe. 

As mentioned above, it is not recemmended to use the case that is included in the kit due to it's pour cooling capabilities. You can [print the case we designed](https://www.printables.com/model/322614-orange-pi-zero-2-case). 

If you prefer a different case, we also made a [collection on Printables](https://www.printables.com/social/288649-obico/collections/346815) with a few other options that have been tested. 

### **4. Mounting the Camera**

You can mount your camera in many different ways depending on your printer. The best mounting solution depends on how you plan to use the camera with your 3D printer.

For example, If you are simply interested in casually monitoring your 3D prints with a camera, you don't have to consider any extra factors. Simply position your camera any way you like. If you are planning to use your webcam to record timelapse videos or take advantage of Obico's Ai failure detection, you may want to consider the angle of the camera further, it's focus and the lighting conditions. Here are a couple of options for mounting your camera:

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-camera-mount-1.jpg)

- Print a mount: 3D printing a mount is a great option. Here are a few mounts tested to work with the camera included with the kit.

| Webcam Mount                                                                | Description                                                             |

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-camera-mount-3.png)

- Use a box, cup, or another surface to elevate the camera. Even a box can provide a nice camera view.


## **Configure Wifi**

Once the Raspberry Pi Imager has finished flashing the OctoPrint software to your SD card, you can remove it from your computer and insert it into the Orange Pi.

### **1. Connect the Orange Pi to your router.**

We will assume most users will be connecting via Wifi although connection via ethernet is recommended whenever possible.

- Connect one end of an ethernet cable to the Orange Pi, and connect the other end to a port on your wireless router. Assuming you will connect to wifi, this is only temporary, so do not worry if this is not where you plan to keep the device.
- Connect the included power supply to the Orange Pi and plug it into an electrical outlet.

### **2. Find the Pi's Ip Address**

- Now, you will need to find the IP address of your Orange Pi. This can be done in multiple ways. The easiest way is to connect to your router's admin portal.

:::tip
If you have an internet provider such as Verizon or Xfinity, instructions for connecting are on the router. In this example, I will access the Verizon wireless router settings by entering the admin username and password found on my router at mynetworksettings.com. The admin username and passwords are often different from the wifi username and password.
:::

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/wifi-router-1.png)

- Under Devices, find the device named orangepizero2. For Verizon routers, the IP address can be found by clicking the gear icon for a particular device.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/ip-address-router.png)

- You are looking for the IPv4 Address. Once you have found it, write it down or copy and paste it into your notes for easy reference.

If you are having trouble finding the IP address for your Orange Pi, there are a few other ways to find it.

- For Windows users, download Angry IP Scanner, a free software, and use it to scan for IP addresses. You are looking for the one that says _orangepizero2_

- Mac users can follow a similar process by downloading Lan Scan, a free IP scanner for mac.

:::tip
If you are not planning to configure wifi, you can skip the rest of this section and go to the **Connecting to OctoPrint** section.
:::

### **3. SSH into Your Orange Pi**

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/ssh-orange-pi.png)

- Now, open a terminal window. For Mac users, Terminal can be found in your applications Windows users will find the Command Prompt in programs.

- SSH into your Orange Pi. SSH is a secure way to access network services securely over an unsecured network. Type the following command:

```
ssh pi@your-ip-address
```

- Enter the password. The password is **orangepi.** You will not see the letters as you type the password, but they are still being entered.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/orange-pi-zero-2-welcome.png)

- Hit enter to confirm the password. You will then be greeted with the _Opi Zero2_ logo confirming you are logged in.

### **4. Connect to your wireless network**

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/nmtui-connect-wifi.png)

- Enter the following command to open up the network configuration menu. You can simply copy and paste the command into the terminal and then hit enter on your keyboard to execute the command.
  
```
nmtui
```


![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/edit-connection-nmtui.png)

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/activate-connection-nmtui.png)

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight _Activate a connection_ and then use the cursor to highlight *OK* and click enter.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/activate-wifi.png)

- Use the arrow keys again to highlight your wifi address name, and then hit enter on your keyboard.
- Enter the password for your wifi as it appears on your router. Hit enter to confirm.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/wifi-activated.png)

- You can verify your wifi has been connected succesfully when the upper right indicator switches from \<activate\> to \<deactivate\>. Once confirmed, move the arrow key to back and hit enter.

### **5. Find your Wireless IP address**

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/find-wlan.png)

- Next, lets get the wireless ip address that was assigned to your orangepi. Enter the following command and hit enter.

```
sudo ifconfig -a
```


- In the output, find the line that starts with _wlan0:_ and note the IP address next to _inet._ Write it down or store it in your notes for easy reference.

## **Connect the Orange Pi to your printer**

### **1. Move the Pi to it's permanent location**

- Disconnect the Orange Pi from the ethernet cable, and move it to where you plan to connect it with your printer.

### **2. Connect the Hardware**

- Plug USB hub cable into the orange pi.
- Plug the camera into the USB hub
- Plug the Printer cable into the USB hub.
- Plug the power cable into the Orange Pi and into the electrical outlet
- Plug the USB printer cable into the printer with the printer on.

## **Connect to OctoPrint**

### **1. Access the OctoPrint User Interface**

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-setup-wizard-1.png)


- Open an internet browser and enter the IP address you just found into the URL bar. You will be greeted with the OctoPrint Setup Wizard.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-access-control.png)

### **2. Complete the Setup Wizard**

- Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the setup wizard such as creating an account.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-printer-profile.png)

- Under *Defauilt Printer Profile*, enter the origin location (usually lower left), whether or not it has a heated bed, and the size of your printers build volume. These settings won't affect your prints, but they help enhance the overall user experience.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-webcam-view.png)

- Click *Finish*, and you will be sent to the OctoPrint User interface.
- Click *Connect* on the left to connect your 3D printer to your Orange Pi Zero 2.
- Click *Control* on the upper tab to see your webcam view.

That's it! You have successfully connected to OctoPrint!

## **Configure Obico for OctoPrint** - optional but encouraged :)

## Hardware requirements {#hardware-requirements}

Before you start, make sure:

- OctoPrint is installed and set up correctly. The easiest way to set up OctoPrint is to get a Raspberry Pi and follow [this guide](https://octoprint.org/download/).
- A webcam is set up for your printer and connected to OctoPrint. The 3D Printing Zone has an [excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWsD2HoId9I) for it.
- There is sufficient lighting to illuminate the printing area of your printer. If your printer is in a lighted room, you are probably fine. If you'll print with light off, you will need to make sure the printing area is illuminated when your printer is printing. A LED strip or small LED lamp will do the trick.


## Step 1: Access "Obico for OctoPrint" plugin wizard. {#step-1-access-obico-for-octoprint-plugin-wizard}

1. Restart OctoPrint by clicking the **power button**

## What's next? {#whats-next}

### Check out your printer feed! {#check-out-your-printer-feed}

Press "Go Check Out Printer Feed!" to see everything you care about your printer: the webcam feed, heater temperature, time remaining on the print job, and more! Remember, you can see your printer feed anywhere you go, as long as you have an internet connection on your phone!

### Test the magical failure detection! {#test-the-magical-failure-detection}

AI-powered failure detection sounds too magical to be true? [See the magic in action for yourself](/docs/user-guides/how-to-test-failure-detection).

### Change printer settings. {#change-printer-settings}

The default settings for your printer in Obico are the ones that most users find the most reasonable. But feel free to tweak them to your liking:

- [Change notification settings](/docs/user-guides/notification-settings) (mobile app only). By default you receive push notifications when a possible print failure is detected. You will also get status update on your lock screen when your printer is printing. But you can choose to receive a lot more.
- [Change printer settings](/docs/user-guides/detection-print-job-settings), such as if Obico should pause your printer when a failure is detected.
