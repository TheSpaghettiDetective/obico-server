import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::caution
 This guide is for the users who use **Moonraker with Klipper**. If you are using OctoPrint with Klipper, please follow the [Obico for OctoPrint guide](octoprint-plugin-setup.md) instead.
:::

:::info
This guide assumes you are connecting to the [Obico Cloud](https://app.obico.io). If you are connecting to a [self-hosted Obico Server](/docs/server-guides/), you will need to use the address of your self-hosted server.
:::

## Hardware requirements

Before you start, make sure:

- You have the Klipper and Moonraker set up correctly and connected to your printer. Also a user interface such as Mainsail/Fluidd is highly recommended.
- A webcam is set up for your printer and connected to Mainsail/Fluidd/Moonraker.
- There is sufficient lighting to illuminate the printing area of your printer. If your printer is in a lighted room, you are probably fine. If you'll print with light off, you will need to make sure the printing area is illuminated when your printer is printing. A LED strip or small LED lamp will do the trick.


## Step 1: Download Obico for Klipper and run `install.sh`

1. SSH to the Raspberry Pi your Klipper runs on.
2. Run:
```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/moonraker-obico.git
    cd moonraker-obico
    ./install.sh
```
3. Follow the installation steps. You may be asked to enter the password in order to run `sudo` commands.
4. If you set up your Klipper platform in one of the common ways, such as [MainsailOS](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/setup/mainsail-os) or [FluiddPi](https://docs.fluidd.xyz/installation/fluiddpi), good for you. `install.sh` will automatically detect your configurations and ask you for confirmation.
5. If you have a custom setup for your Klipper platform, we may have to ask you to enter the configurations necessary for the installation to complete, such as the location of your `moonraker.conf`, Moonraker's port, and the log directory.
6. `install.sh` will now start the process to link your printer to the Obico server. You will be asked to enter:
    - The Obico Server you want to link it to. The default is the [Obico Cloud](https://app.obico.io). You can also change it to using your own [self-hosted Obico Server](https://www.obico.io/docs/server-guides/) (ex: http://192.168.0.5:3334).
    - A **6-digit verification code**. You will obtain this 6-digit verification code in the following steps.
7. Leave the terminal open. We will come back to enter the 6-digit code once we obtain it from the Obico app.

## Step 2: Sign up for an Obico account.

:::tip

Follow instructions in the "**üì±  Mobile App**" tab if you are using the Obico mobile app, or the "**üåê  Web App**" tab if you are using the web app.

:::

:::info

Your Obico account is the same for the mobile app and the web app. If you sign up for an account using the mobile app, you can sign in to the web app later with the same email and password. And vice versa.

:::

:::info

All functions are available equally in the mobile and the web app. However, with the mobile app, you can receive push notifications on your phone to easily track the print progress, and get alerted in case a failure is detected.

## Step 3: Launch the "Link Printer" wizard in the Obico app

<Tabs
  groupId="app"
  defaultValue="mobile"
  values={[
    {label: 'üì±  Mobile App', value: 'mobile'},
    {label: 'üåê  Web App', value: 'web'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="mobile">

  <TabItem value="web">

On the welcome page, click the "**Link Printer**" button.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Obtain the 6-digit verification code

<Tabs
  groupId="app"
  defaultValue="mobile"
  values={[
    {label: 'üì±  Mobile App', value: 'mobile'},
    {label: 'üåê  Web App', value: 'web'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="mobile">

1. Choose "**Klipper**" on the next screen.
1. Assuming you have followed the previous steps and run the `install.sh` script, simply press "**Yes. Obico for Klipper is installed**".
1. Now you will see a screen with a 6-digit verification code. This is the code you will use to link your printer. You can long-press the number to copy it to the clipboard.

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}><img src="/img/user-guides/setupguide/klipper-verification-code-mobile.jpg" /></div>

<div />

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="web">

1. Click "Klipper" on the page that asks you to select a platform.

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}><img src="/img/user-guides/setupguide/select-platform-web.jpg" /></div>

2. Assuming you have followed Step 1 and run the `install.sh` script, you can simply click the "**Next>**" button.
3. Now you will see a screen with a 6-digit verification code. You can press Ctrl-C (Windows) or Cmd-C (Mac) to copy the 6 digit code to the clipboard.

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}><img src="/img/user-guides/setupguide/klipper-verification-code-web.jpg" /></div>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Enter the 6-digit code

1. Go back to terminal for your SSH session in Step 1.
1. Enter the 6-digit code you obtained in the previous step.
1. As the final step, you will be asked if you want to opt in bug reporting. We strongly recommend you answer "Y" here. Bug reporting will help us catch and fix bugs earlier and more easily, and hence a better Obico app for you! :)

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}><img src="/img/user-guides/setupguide/link-success-klipper.png" /></div>
<br />

Hooray! You are done! You can now close the terminal. Obico for Klipper is now running as a system service.

## Step 6 (optional): Give your printer a shinny name!

Optionally, you can now give your printer a name. If you skip this step, your printer will have the default name "*My Awesome Cloud Printer*".

## What's next?

### Check out your printer feed!

Press "Go Check Out Printer Feed!" to see everything you care about your printer: the webcam feed, heater temperature, time remaining on the print job, and more! Remember, you can see your printer feed anywhere you go, as long as you have an internet connection on your phone!

### Test the magical failure detection!

The Detective sounds too magical to be true? [See The Detective in action for yourself](/docs/user-guides/how-to-test-failure-detection).

### Change printer settings.

The default settings for your printer in The Spaghetti Detective are the ones that most users find the most reasonable. But feel free to tweak them to your liking:

- [Change notification settings](/docs/user-guides/notification-settings) (mobile app only). By default you receive push notifications when The Detective finds something fishy, and for the status of whatever your printer is printing. But you can choose to receive a lot more.
- [Change printer settings](/docs/user-guides/detection-print-job-settings), such as if The Detective should pause your printer when a failure is detected.
