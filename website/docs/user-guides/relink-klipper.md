## Why would you re-link your printer? {#why-would-you-re-link-your-printer}

Consider re-linking in one of the following cases:

* You accidentally deleted a printer in the Obico app.
* Your printer is always showing "**offline**" in the app, and you have gone through [all the trouble-shooting steps](/docs/user-guides/troubleshoot-server-connection-issues).
* You don't remember the password of your old the Obico account so you have to sign up for a new account. Now you want to re-link your printer to the new account.

## How to re-link? {#how-to-re-link}

Follow [this guide](/docs/user-guides/octoprint-plugin-setup-manual-link/) to re-link printer with a 6-digit code.
