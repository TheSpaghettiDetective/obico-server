## Why would you re-link OctoPrint?

Consider re-linking OctoPrint in one of the following cases:

* You accidentally deleted a printer in The Spaghetti Detective app.
* Your printer is always showing "**offline**" in The Spaghetti Detective app, and you have gone through [all the trouble-shooting steps](/docs/user-guides/troubleshoot-server-connection-issues).
* You don't remember the password of your old The Spaghetti Detective account so you have to sign up for a new account. Now you want to re-link your OctoPrint to the new account.
