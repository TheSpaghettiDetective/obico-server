If some of your printers have been archived, that's because you have more printers than your plan allows.

## The number of printers your plan allows {#the-number-of-printers-your-plan-allows}

* If your account is on the Free plan, you can't have more than 1 printer.

* If your account is on the Pro plan, you can add unlimited number of printers to your plan with as low as $2 per printer per month.

Learn more about the limits of the Free plan on [the pricing page](https://app.obico.io/ent_pub/pricing/).

## How can I un-archive my printers? {#how-can-i-un-archive-my-printers}

In order to un-archive your printers, you need to make sure your plan allows at least the combined number of the active printers and the printers you intend to un-archive.

For instance, if you have subscribed for 3 printers in your Pro plan, and you already have 2 active printers, you can still un-archive up to 1 printer.

There are a few things you can do to make sure your plan has enough number of printers:

* Delete the printers you no longer need. You can delete active printers or archived printers.
* [Upgrade to the Pro plan](https://app.obico.io/ent_pub/pricing/) if you are currently on the Free plan.
* If you are already on the Pro plan, you can change the number of printers on [your subscription page](https://app.obico.io/user_preferences/subscription/).

Once your account is set up to allow for more printers, come back to the [printer archive page](https://app.obico.io/ent/printers/archived/) and un-archive the printers there.
