The Obico plugin will try a few options to give you a smooth webcam stream. However, in some rare situations, the Obico plugin can't find any viable option to make the webcam streaming work. In these cases, it will "stream" by taking one webcam snapshot every 10 seconds.

When this happens, you'll have the laggy, 1-frame-per-10-seconds streaming. And the plugin will pop up this warning message to alert you. Follow [this guide](/docs/user-guides/webcam-stream-stuck-at-1-10-fps/) to figure out why.
