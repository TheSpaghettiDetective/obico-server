This warning message means the webcam streaming process has failed to start for some reason.


In some rare situations, the Obico plugin can't find any viable option to make the webcam streaming work. In these cases, it will "stream" by taking one webcam snapshot every 10 seconds.

When this happens, you'll have the laggy, 1-frame-per-10-seconds streaming. Follow [this guide](/docs/user-guides/webcam-stream-stuck-at-1-10-fps/) to figure out why.
