:::info
The failure detection is not impacted in any way even if the webcam stream is stuck in 0.1 FPS. This is because the failure detection is designed to work best at 0.1 FPS.

## "Janus not found" error.

The most common cause for this problem is that [Janus is not installed on your printer or SBC](/docs/user-guides/webcam-install-janus/). When this is the case, you will also see a warning in the Obico app:

![Janus Not Found](/img/user-guides/helpdocs/janus-not-found-warning.png)

The solution is to install Janus on your printer or SBC. [Follow this guide for details](/docs/user-guides/webcam-install-janus/).

## Network settings for self-hosted Obico server

Self-hosted Obico server supports Premium Streaming. However, it's possible the WebRTC connection can't be established due to your network configurations (firewall, routing, NAT configuration in your router, etc). To check if this is the case, [re-link your printer to the Obico cloud](/docs/user-guides/relink-printer/). If the issue is gone, the problem is with the settings of your server or its network configuration.

## Is the webcam streaming disabled? {#1-is-the-webcam-streaming-disabled}

Not all Operating Systems that can run on your printer or Raspberry Pi has the libraries required for the webcam streaming. Make sure you flashed the SD card using the supported OS images if you want to have a smooth webcam stream in Obico.

If you are not sure if the OS causes the webcam stream to be stuck at 0.1 FPS, grab a spare SD card, flash it with one of the supported OS images, and see if you are getting a smooth webcam stream in the Obico app now.
