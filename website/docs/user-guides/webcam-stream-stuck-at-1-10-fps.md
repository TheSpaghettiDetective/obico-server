title: Webcam stream is only 0.1 FPS
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Follow this troubleshooting guide if the webcam is streaming at a very low frame rate (about 0.1 FPS, or 1 frame per 10 seconds), and the webcam stream mode is shown as *0.1 FPS*.

:::info
The failure detection is not impacted in any ways even if the webcam stream is stuck in 0.1 FPS. This is because the failure detection is designed to work best at 0.1 FPS.
:::

:::tip
Follow [this guide](/docs/user-guides/check-webcam-streaming-mode/) to find out the current webcam streaming mode.

## 1. Is the webcam streaming disabled? {#1-is-the-webcam-streaming-disabled}

By default, the webcam streaming is enabled. Let's make sure it has not been disabled.

    {label: 'Obico for OctoPrint', value: 'octoprint'},
    {label: 'Obico for Klipper', value: 'klipper'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="octoprint">

1. Open OctoPrint settings page by clicking the wrench icon (**ðŸ”§**).
1. Scroll down the navigation bar on the left side.
1. Click the "Obico for OctoPrint" tab.
1. Click the "Settings" button.
1. Is "Disable webcam streaming" checked?

![Disable video streaming](/img/user-guides/settings-disable-25-fps-streaming.png)

Uncheck the "Disable webcam streaming" if it's currently checked. Don't forget to click the "Save" button and restart OctoPrint afterward.

1. Open the `moonraker-obico.cfg` file.
2. If the "[webcam] -> disable_video_streaming" setting is set to `True`, either remove this setting, or set it to `False` (default value).
3. Restart the Raspberry Pi.

:::info
There are [a few rare reasons](/docs/user-guides/disable-25-fps-streaming) why you may want to have the webcam streaming disabled.

## 2. Is OctoPrint running on a Raspberry Pi? {#2-is-octoprint-running-on-a-raspberry-pi}

The webcam streaming requires Raspberry Pi to work. It is well tested on **Raspberry Pi 4B, Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+, and Zero/Zero W**.

If you are not using a Raspberry Pi, the Obico plugin will only "stream" by taking one snapshot from the webcam every 10 seconds.

:::caution

If you have installed docker on the Raspberry Pi, and are running OctoPrint Or Klipper/Moonraker inside the docker containers, you won't get the webcam stream either.

:::

:::info
The reason why Raspberry Pi is required for the webcam streaming is because it has a special hardware accelerator required to encode H.264 video efficiently.
:::

## 3. Try "always stream in compatibility mode" (OctoPrint only) {#3-try-always-stream-in-compatibility-mode}

In most cases, the webcam streaming will automatically switch between the compatibility mode the advanced mode. But there is a slight possibility it will get stuck in the "wrong" mode and hence fail.

Try to [set the compatibility mode set to "**always**"](/docs/user-guides/streaming-compatibility-mode#how-to-change-the-compatibility-mode-setting) to see if it'll get it out of the "Basic" streaming mode. **You need to restart the Raspberry Pi after the switch**.

:::info
Learn more about [advanced mode and compatibility mode](/docs/user-guides/streaming-compatibility-mode).
:::

:::tip
This step is relevant only to OctoPrint users. Obico for Klipper always uses the compatibility mode for webcam streaming.

## 4. Are you using an OS image that doesn't support streaming? {#4-did-you-use-the-official-octopi-image-to-flash-the-sd-card}

Not all Operating Systems that can run on a Rapsberry Pi has the libraies required for the webcamm streaming. Make sure you flashed the SD card using the supported OS images if you want to have a smooth webcam stream in Obico.

If you are not sure if the OS causes the webcam stream to be stuck at 0.1 FPS, grab a spare SD card, flash it with one of the supported OS images, and see if you are getting a smooth webcam stream in the Obico app now.
