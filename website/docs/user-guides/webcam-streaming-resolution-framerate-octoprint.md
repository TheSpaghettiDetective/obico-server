title: Webcam streaming resolution and framerate (OctoPrint)
---

:::tip
Most of the time you can leave the Obico for OctoPrint to pick the appropriate webcam streaming resolution and framerate. You don't have to worry about them.
:::

:::caution
Please keep in mind that most SBCs have a weak CPU. If the resolution and/or framerate is set to high, it may overwhelm the SBC's CPU and hence cause print quality issues. If you are not sure, please read [this doc](webcam-streaming-excessive-cpu.md) before changing the resolution and/or framerate.
